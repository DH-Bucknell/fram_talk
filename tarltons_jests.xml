                     humor, commanded that he should have no more, for quoth she, "he will play the
                     beast and so shame himself." "Fear not you," quoth Tarlton, "for your beer is
                     small enough." Whereat her Majesty laughed heartily, and commanded that he
                     should have enough. </p>

                     fast, thinking by that means to go unexamined; but the Watchmen perceiving
                     that he shunned them, stepped to him and commanded him (in the Queen's name) to
                     stand. "Stand", quoth Tarlton, 'let them stand that can, for I cannot." So falling
                     down as though he had been drunk, they helped him up, and so let him pass.

                     the body fare the worse for it." At which the rest of the ladies laughed, and she

                     seeing Tarlton, called him, and asked if he loved oysters. "No," quoth Tarlton, "for they be ungodly meat, uncharitable meat, &amp; unprofitable meat." "Why?" quoth the Courtiers. "They are ungodly, because they are eaten without grace; uncharitable, because they leave nought but shells; and unprofitable, because
                     they must swim in wine."</p>

                     the Courtier. "Marry," answered he, "then all the devils are troubled and busied

                     desirous that she would vouchsafe to stay all night, but nothing could prevail with her. Tarlton was in his clown's apparell, being at dinner while in the
                     presence with her, to make her merry, and hearing the sorrow that the noblemen
                     made that they could not work her stay, he asked the nobles what they would
                     give him to work her stay The lords promised him any thing, to perform it. Quoth he, "procure me the Parsonage of Shard." They caused the patent to be
                     drawn presently, he got on a <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" generatedBy="human" instant="unknown" type="clothing" xml:space="default">parson's gown</objectName>, and a <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" generatedBy="human" instant="unknown" type="clothing" xml:space="default">corner cap</objectName>, and standing upon the stairs where the Queen should descend, he repeated these words: "a parson or no parson? A parson or no parson?" But after she knew his meaning, she
                     not only stayed all night, but the next day willed he should have possession
                     of the benefice. A madder parson was never, for he threatened to turn the bell metal into lining for his purse, which he did, the parsonage and all,
                     into ready money. </p>

                     honester?" "I," says the one, "I hope without exceptions." "And I," quoth the other, "since we must speak for ourselves." "So then," says Tarlton, "one of you by your
                     own words is dishonest: one being honester then the other, else you would
                     answer otherwise. But as I found you, so I leave you."</p>

                     backward? Then cuff me and spare not." When the gentlemen by considered of the word, their laughing made the simple-meaning gentlewoman to blush for shame.

                     one another. Quoth one, "I ever durst any thing that is honest and honourable." "A French crown of that," says Tarlton. "Ten pound of that," says the Lady. "Done," says one. "Done," says another. Tarlton put a <rs>two-pence</rs> betwixt his lips, and
                     dared her to take it away with her lips. "Fie," says she, "that is immodesty." "What, to kiss?" says Tarlton. "Then immodesty bears a great hand over all. But
                     once in your life say, you haue been beaten at your own weapon." "Well sir," says she, "you may say any thing." "Then," says Tarlton, "remember I say you dare
                     not, and so my wager is good."</p>

                  <p>TArlton being one Sunday at Court all day, caused a payre of Oares to tend him,
                     who at night called on him to be gone: Tarlton being a carousing,drunke so long
                     to the Watermen, that one of them was bumpsie, and so indéed were all thrée for
                     the most part: at last they left Gréenwitch, the Tide being at a great low
                     fall, the Watermen yet affraid of the crosse Cables by the Lime-house: very
                     darke and late as it was, landed Tarlton at Cuckolds-hauen, and said the next
                     day they would giue him a reason for it: But Tarlton was faine to goe by land
                     to Reddriffe on the durty banke, euery step knée déepe: so that comming home,
                     hee called one of his boyes to helpe him off with his boots, meaning his
                     stockings, which were dyed of another colour. Whereupon one gaue him this
                     Theame next day. </p>

                  </lg>
                  <ab>Tarlton answered thus:</ab>

                     <l>Yes Sir, and I tak't in no scorne,</l>

                  <head>How Tarlton fought with Blacke Dauie,</head>
                  <p>NOt long since liued a little swaggerer, called blacke Dauie, who would at
                     Sword and Buckler fight with any gentleman or other, for 12. pence: he being
                     hired to draw vpon Tarlton, for breaking a iest vpon huffin Kate, a puncke as
                     men tearmed her: one euening Tarlton comming forth at the Court-gate, being at
                     Whitehal, and walking toward the Tilt-yard, this Dauie immediatly drew vpon
                     Tarlton: who on the sudden, though amazed, drew likewise, and inquired the
                     cause, which Dauie denied, till they had fought about or two: Tarlton
                     couragiously got within him, and taking him in his armes, threw him into the
                     Tilt-yard, who falling vpon his nose, broke it extreamely, that euer after he
                     snuffled in the head; poore Dauie lying all that night in the Tilt-yard,
                     expecting the doores to be opened, came forth, and at the Barber▪ surgeons told
                     of this bloody combat, and the occasion of it was (quoth hee) because Tarlton
                     being in a Tauerne in the companie of this damnable Cockatrice huffing Kate,
                     called for wine: but she told him that without he would burne it, she would not
                     drinke. No quoth Tarlton, it shal be burnt, for thou canst burn it without
                     fire: as how sir? (quoth she) marry thus, take the Cup in thine hand &amp; I
                     will tell thée: So he filling the cup in her hand, said it was burnt
                     sufficiently in so fiery a place: she perceiuing her selfe so flouted, hyred me
                     to be her Champion to reuenge her quarrell. </p>

                  <p>TArlton hauing plaied before the Quéen, till one a clock at midnight, comming
                     homewards, one of them espied him, calling him, sirra, what art thou? a woman,
                     sayes Tarlton: nay that is lie, saith the Watchmen, women haue no such beards:
                     Tarlton replied, if I should haue said a man, that you know to be true, and
                     would haue bidden mee tell you that you know not, therefore I sayd a Woman, and
                     so I am all woman, hauing pleased the Quéene, being a Woman: Well sirra sayes
                     another, I present the Quéene: then am I a woman indéed saies Tarlton as well
                     as you, for you haue a beard as well as I, and truly Mistris Annis, my buske is
                     not done yet, when will yours? leaue thy gybing fellow, saith the Watch; the
                     Quéens will is that whosoeuer is taken without doores after ten a clocke, shall
                     be committed, and now it is past one: commit all such sayes Tarlton, for if it
                     be past one a clocke, it will not be ten this eight houres: with that one lifts
                     vp his Lanthorne, and looks him in the face, and knew him: indéed M. Tarlton
                     you haue more wit then all we, for it is true that ten was before one, but now
                     one is before ten, it is true quoth Tarlton, Watchmen had wont to haue more
                     wit, but for want of sléepe they are turned fooles: so Tarlton stole from them,
                     and they to séeme wise went home to bed. </p>

                     and Tridimus: Tarlton being somewhat abashed, not knowing the meaning thereof,
                     sayd: Sir, I vnderstand you not, expound I pray you: quoth the Courtier Didimus
                     and Tridimus, is a foole and a knaue: you ouer-load me replyed Tarlton, for my
                     backe cannot beare both, therefore take you the one, and I will take the other:
                     take you the knaue, and I will carry the foole with me. </p>

                     resembled: quoth he, as if you should first haue eaten the Hen, and after the

                     being set amongst the Gentlemen and Gallants, they enquired of him why
                     melancholy had got the vpper-hand of his mirth, to which he said little, but
                     with a squint eie, as custom had made him hare▪ eied, he lookt for a Iest to
                     make them merry; at last he espyed one that sate on his left side, which had a
                     very red face, hee being a very great Gentleman (which was all one to Tarlton )
                     he presently in great hast called his Hoast: who do I serue my Hoast? quoth
                     Tarlton, the Quéenes Maiestie, replied the good man of the house: how happens
                     it then quoth Tarlton, that to her Maiesties disgrace, you dare make me a

                     and his beard of the Italian cut, in white Satten, very quaintly cut, and his
                     body so stiffe starcht, that he could not bend himselfe any way for no gold:
                     Tarlton, séeing such a wonder comming, trips before him, and méeting this
                     gallant tooke the wall of him, knowing that one so proud, at least looked for
                     the prerogatiue. The gallant scorning that a Player should take the wall, or so
                     much indignifie him, turnes himselfe, and presently drew his Rapier, Tarlton
                     drew likewise: The Gentleman fell to it roundly, but Tarlton in his owne
                     defence, compassing and trauersing his ground, gaped with a wide mouth, whereat
                     the people laughed: the Gentleman pausing, enquired why he gaped so? O Sir
                     saies he, in hope to swallow you, for by my troth, you séeme to me like a prune
                     in a Mesle of white Broth: at this the people parted them, the Gentleman noting
                     his mad humour, went his way well contented, for he knew not how to amend it.

                     that had neuer séene him, that is he: Tarlton to make sport at the least
                     occasion giuen him, and séeing the man point with one finger, he in loue againe
                     held vp two fingers: the captious fellow iealous of his wife (for he was
                     maried) and because a Player did it, tooke the matter more hainously, and askt
                     him why hee made Hornes at him: No quoth Tarlton, they be fingers: </ab>
                  <lg>
                     <l>For there is no man which in loue to mee</l>

                  </lg>
                  <ab>No, no, sayes the fellow, you gaue me the hornes: true saies Tarlton, for my

                  <p>A Iest came in Tarltons head where to dine, and thought he, in all that a man
                     does, let him ayme at the fairest, for sure if. I bid my selfe any where this
                     day, it shall be to my Lord Maiors: and vpon this, goes to the Counter and
                     entred his action against my Lord Maior, who was presently told of it, and
                     sends for him. Tarlton waits dinner time, and then comes, who was admitted
                     presently. Master Tarlton, sayes my Lord Maior, haue you entred an action
                     against me in the Poultry Counter? My Lord, sayes Tarlton, haue you entred an
                     action against me in Woodstréet Counter? Not I in troth, saies my Lord. No
                     saies Tarlton, he was a villaine that told me so then: but if it be not so,
                     forgiue me this fault my Lord, and I will neuer offend in the next: but in the
                     end he begins to sweare, how he will bee reuenged on him that mockt him, and
                     flings out in a rage, But my Lord sayd, stay M. Tarlton, dine with me, and no
                     doubt but after dinner you will be better minded. I will try that my Lord,
                     saies Tarlton, and if it alter mine anger, both mine enemie &amp; I will thanke
                     you together for this curtesie. </p>

                     the fellow, for by my troth as yet I cannot? Well said Tarlton, the more foole

                     Tarlton, two said the other Taylor: then you say true, said Tarlton: for two
                     Taylors goes to a man. But before they parted, they foxt Tarlton, at the Castle
                     in Paternoster Row, that Tarlton confest them two Taylors to be honest men: so
                     what they spent in the purse they got in the person: comming but one by
                     Tarltons account, they returned two: but Tarlton comming one, returned lesse by

                     street, but intreats him to kéepe one side and she another, which he consented
                     to: but as he went he would cry out to her and say, Turne that way wife, and
                     anon on this side wife: so the people flockt the more to laugh at them, but his
                     wife more then mad angry, goes backe againe, and almost forswore his company.

                  <head>How Tarlton committed a Rakers horse to Ward.</head>
                  <p>VVhen Tarlton dwelt in Gracious stréet, at a Tauerne at the signe of the Saba,
                     he was chosen Scauenger: and often the Ward complained of his slacknes in
                     kéeping the stréets cleane: so on a time when the Cart came, he asked the
                     Raker, why he did his businesse so slackly. Sir said he, my fore-horse was in
                     the fault, who being let blood and drencht yesterday, I durst not labour him:
                     sir said Tarlton, your horse shall smart for it, and so leads him to the
                     Counter, which the Raker laught at, and without his horse did his worke with
                     the rest, thinking Tarltons homor was to iest, and would returne him his horse
                     againe anon: but when that anon came, he was faine to pay all his fées of the
                     prison, as directly as if he himselfe had béene there: for if Tarlton had
                     committed the master, the busines had not gone forward, therefore the horse was
                     in prison for the Master. </p>

                  <ab>TArlton kéeping a Tauerne in Gracious stréet, hee let it to another, who was
                     indebted to Armins Master, a Gold smith in Lumbard stréet: yet he himselfe had
                     a Chamber in the same house. And this Armin being then a wag came often thither
                     to demaund his Masters money, which hee sometimes had, and sometimes had not:
                     in the end the man growing poore, told the boy he had no money for his Master,
                     and he must beare with him. The mans name being Charles, Armin made this verse,
                     writing it with chalke on a waine-scot: </ab>

                     Gracious stréete, getting money with him (as he was mightily resorted
                     to:)Tarlton then (with his fellowes) playing at the Bell by, came into the

                     Tarlton forth: Tarlton with merry words said nothing, but God a mercy Horse: in
                     the end, Tarlton séeing the people laugh so, was angry inwardly, and said, Sir,
                     had I power of your horse, as you haue, I would doe more then that. Where ere
                     it be said Bankes (to please him) I will charge him to do it: then saies
                     Tarlton, charge him to bring me the veriest whore-master in this company. He
                     shall saies Bankes: Signior saies he, bring M. Tarlton heere the veriest

                     Bancks &amp; Tarlton had like to squarde, and the horse by to giue ayme: but
                     euer after it was a by-word through London, God a mercy horse, and is to this

                  <p>AT the Bull at Bishops-gate was a play of Henry the fift, wherein the Iudge was
                     to take a boxe on the eare, and because he was absent that should take the
                     blow: Tarlton himselfe (euer forward to please) tooke upon him to play the same
                     Iudge, besides his owne part of the Clowne: and Knell then playing Henry the
                     fift, hit Tarlton a sound boxe indéed, which made the people laugh the more,
                     because it was he: but anone the Iudge goes in, &amp; immediatly Tarlton (in
                     his Clownes clothes) comes out, and askes the Actors what newes? O saith one,
                     hadst thou béene here, thou shouldst haue séene Prince Henry hit the Iudge a
                     terribly▪ boxe on the eare: What man, said Tarlton, strike a Iudge? It is true
                     y faith, said the other: no other like, said Tarlton, and it could not be but
                     terrible to the Iudge, when the report so terrifies me, that me thinkes the
                     blow remaines still on my chéeke, that it burnes againe. The people laught at
                     this mightily, and to this day I haue heard it commended for rare: but no
                     maruaile, for he had many of these. But I would sée our Clownes in these dayes
                     doe the like, no I warrant ye, and yet they thinke well of themselues too. </p>

                     fast, said the Boy? because they want breath, said Tarlton: no rather said the
                     Boy, because their time is come: then thy time is come, said Tarlton, sée who
                     comes yonder: Who? said the Boy: Marry said Tarlton, Bull the hangman: or one
                     that would willingly be thy hangman: Nay, hang me then, if I employ him at this
                     time, said the Boy. Well said Tarlton, then thou wilt be hanged by thy owne

                     so sayes one? It is like a witty skold, méeting another skold, knowing that
                     skold will skold, begins to skold first, so saies he, the Mustard being lickt
                     vp, and knowing that you will bite it, begins to bite you first: Ile trie that
                     saies a Gull by, and the Mustard so tickled him, that his eyes watered: how now
                     sayes Tarlton, does my Iest sauour? I, saies the Gull, and bite too: if you had
                     had better wit, sayes Tarlton, you would haue bit first: so then conclude with
                     me, that dumbe vnféeling Mustard, hath more wit then a talking vnféeling foole
                     as you are. Some were pleased and some were not, but all Tarltons care was

                     two men ouercome with wine, and they neuer séeing the like, wondred at it, and
                     séeing the vapour come out of Tarltons nose, cried out, fire, fire, and threw a
                     cup of wine in Tarltons face: Make no more stirre quoth Tarlton, the fire is
                     quenched, if the Sheriffes come it will turne to a fine, as the custome is. And
                     drinking that againe, fie sayes the other, what a stincke it makes, I am almost
                     poisoned: If it offend, sayes Tarlton, lets euery one take a little of the
                     smell, and so the sauour will quickly goe: but Tobacco whiffes made them leaue
                     him to pay all. </p>

                     Sunbanke, one morning secretly married his Maid; but not so secret, but it was
                     blowne abroad: that morning, Tarlton and others, walking in the Faire to visit
                     his familiar friends of London, and being in company of Bristow men, they did
                     sée M. Sunbancke comming, who had this propertie with his necke, not to stirre

                     to pisse against a wall: to whom Tarlton came, and clapping him on the

                     pissing against the wall, would haue lookt backe to thanke him, and suddainly
                     turnes about body and all, in the view of many, and shewed all: which so abasht

                     Tarlton, saies M. Sunbancke? I Sir, saies the Vintner, he is the Quéens Iester:

                     the Waggon vnloading of the apparell, the Waggoner comes to Tarlton, &amp; doth
                     desire him to speake to the Steward for his horses: I will sayes he, and
                     comming to the Steward, Sir, saies Tarlton, where shall our Horses spend the
                     time? The Gentleman looking at Tarlton at that question, suddenly answered, if
                     it please you, or them, let them walke a turne or two: or there is a faire
                     Garden, let them play a game or two at bowles in the Alley, and departs thence
                     about his other businesse. Tarlton commending the suddaine wit of the steward,
                     said little: but my Steward not quiet, tels to the Gentlewomen aboue, how he
                     had driuen Tarlton to a nonplus with a iest: whereat they all did laugh
                     heartily: which a Seruingman louing Tarlton well, came and told him as much.
                     Tarlton to adde fuell to the fire, and loath to rest thus put off with a iest,
                     goes and gets two of the horses into the Garden, and turns them into the

                     a foolish match that I made: now they being in play at bowles, run, run: your

                     steward had no thankes for his labour, to set the horses to such an exercise:
                     and they could not blame Tarlton, who did but as he was bidden: but by this

                  <p>AT Salisbury Tarlton &amp; his fellowes were to play before the Maior &amp; his
                     brethren: but one of his company, a yong man was so drunke that he could not:
                     whereat Tarlton as mad angry, as he was mad drunke, claps me on his legs a huge
                     payre of boults: the fellow dead asléep felt nothing: when all was done, they
                     conuaied him to the Iayle on a mans backe, and intreated the Iayler to doe God
                     good seruice, and let him lie there till he waked. While they were about their
                     sport the fellow waked, and finding himselfe in durance, and the Iayle hung
                     round with bolts and shakels, he began to blesse himselfe, and thought sure in
                     his drunkennes he had done some mischiefe: with that he called to know, but
                     none came to him, then he thought verely his fault was capitall, and that hee
                     was close prisoner: by and by comes the Kéeper, and moaned him, that one so
                     yong should come to so shamefull a death as hanging: anone, another comes, and
                     another with the like, which further put him in a puzzle: but at last comes
                     Tarlton and others, intreating the Kéeper, yet if it might be, that they might
                     sée their fellow ere they went, but hee very hardly was intreated, but at
                     length the poore drunken Signior cal'd out for them: in they come. Oh Tom,
                     sayes Tarlton, hard was thy hap in drunkennesse to murder this honest man, and
                     our hard hap too, to haue it reported any of our company is hangd for it. O
                     God, O God saies the fellow, is my fault so great? then commend me to all my
                     friends. Well, short tale to make, the fellow forswore drunkennesse if he could
                     escape, and by as cunning a wile to his thinking, they got him out of prison by
                     an escape, and sent him to London before, who was not a litle glad he was gone:
                     but sée how this Iest wrought, by little and little the fellow left his
                     excessiue drinking, and in timealtered his desire of drunkennesse. </p>

                     worship to do, you can as easily strike off two heads at one blow as one:
                     wherefore, if you please▪ Ile go downe and call vp another, and so you may

                     an eye-maker, and the other a light maker: what sayst thou knaue, doest mocke
                     me? the one is an eye-maker, the other a light maker, which two properties
                     belong vnto God onely: commit these blasphemers quoth the Constable: Nay, I
                     pray you good M. Constable be good in your Office, I will approue what I haue
                     sayd to be true. If thou canst, sayes the Constable, you shall passe, otherwise
                     you shall be all thrée punished. Why quoth Tarlton, this fellow is an
                     eye-maker, because a Spectacle maker, and this other a maker of light, because
                     a Chandler, that makes your darkest night as light as your Lanthorne. The

                  <head>How Tarlton deceiued an Inne-holder at Sandwich.</head>
                  <p>VPon a time when the Plaiers were put to silence, Tarlton and his boy frolickt
                     so long in the Country, that all their money was gone, and being a great way
                     from London, they knew not what to doe; but as want is the whetstone of wit,
                     Tarlton gathereth his conceit together, and practised a tricke to beare him vp
                     to London without money, &amp; thus it was: Vnto an Inne in Sandwich they went,
                     and there lay for two daies at great charge, although he had no money to pay
                     for the same: the third morning he bad his man go downe and male-content
                     himselfe before his Hoast and his Hoastesse, &amp; mumbling say to himselfe,
                     Lord▪ Lord, what a scalde master doe I serue, this it is to serue such Seminary
                     Priests and Iesuits, now euen as I am an honest boy, Ile leaue him in the
                     lurch, and shift for my selfe: here's a doe about penance and mortification, as
                     though (forsooth) Christ hath not died enough for all: The boy mumbled out
                     these his instructions so dissembling, that it strooke a iealousie in the
                     Inne-holders heart, that out of doubt his master was a Seminary Priest;
                     whereupon he presently sent for the Constable, and told him all the foresaid
                     matter, and so went vp both together to attach Tarlton in his chamber, who
                     purposely had shut himselfe close in, and betaken him to his knées, and to his
                     crosses, to make the matter séeme more suspitious, which they espying through
                     the Key-hole, made no more adoe, but in they rushed, and arrested him for a
                     Seminary Priest, discharged his score, bore his, and his boyes charges vp to
                     London, and there in hope to haue rich rewards, presented him to M. Fleetwood,
                     the old Recorder of London: but now marke the Iest; when the Recorder saw
                     Tarlton, and knew him passing well, entertained him very courteously, and all
                     to be foold the Inne-holder and his mate, and sent them away with fleas in
                     their eares: but when Tarlton saw himselfe discharged out of their hands, he
                     stood jesting and pointing at their folly, and so taught them by cunning more
                     wit and thrift against another time. </p>

                  <head>Of Tarlton's wrongfull accusation.</head>
                  <p>Upon a time, Tarlton was wrongfully accused for getting of a gentleman's maid
                     with child, and for the same brought before a justice in Kent, which justice
                     said as followeth : It is a mervaile, M. Tarlton, that you, being a gentleman
                     of good qualitie, and one of her majesties servants, would venture thus to get
                     maides with childe. Nay, rather, quoth Tarlton, were it marvell, if a maid had
                     gotten me with child. </p>

               <div>
                  <head>Tarlton deceived by a country wench.</head>
                  <p>Tarlton travelling to play abroad, was in a towne where, in the inne, was a
                     pretty maid, whose favour was placed in a corner of Tsrlton's affection: and
                     talking with her, shee appoynted to meet him at the bottom of a paire of
                     staires. Night and the houre came, and the maid subtily sent downe her
                     mistresse ; whome Tarlton catching in his armes, Art come, wench ? saies hee.
                     Out, alas, sayes the mietres, not knowing who it was. Tarlton, hearing it was
                     the mistris, start aside, and the maid came downe with a candle, and she espyed
                     a glimpse of Tarlton in the darke, who stept into another roome. How now,
                     mistres ? said the maid. Something, said shee, affrighted me ; some man, sure,
                     for I heard him speake. No, no, mistresse, said the maid ; it is no man ; it
                     was a bull calf that I shut into a roome till J oho, our pounder, came to have
                     pounded him for a stray. Had I thought that, saith she, I would have hit him
                     such a knocke on his forehead that his home should never have grac'd his
                     coxcombe ; and so she departs up againe, afraid. But how Tarlton tooke this

                  <p>In the country, Tarlton told his oastesse he was a conjuror. 0, sir, sayes she,
                     I had pewter stolne off my shelfe the other day; help me to it, and I will
                     forgive you all the pots of ale you owe mee, which is sixteene dozen. Sayes
                     Tarlton, To morrow morning the divell shall helpe you to it, or I will trounce
                     him. Morning came, and the oastesse and he met in a roome by themselves.
                     Tarlton, to passe the time with exercise of his wit, with circles and tricks
                     falls to conjure, having no more skill then a dogge. But see the jest, how
                     contrarily it fell out : as he was calling out, mons, pons, simul, and sons,
                     and such like, a cat, unexpected, leapt from the gutter window ; which sight so
                     amazed Tarlton, that he skipt thence and threw his hostesse downe, so that he
                     departed with his fellowes, and left her hip out of joynt,, being then in the
                     surgeons hands, and not daring to tell how it came. </p>

                  <p>Tarlton, riding with divers cittizens, his friends, to make merry at Waltham,
                     by the way he met with his oastesse, riding toward London, whome hee of old
                     acquaintance saluted. Shee demands whither they went. Tarlton told her, to make
                     merry at Waltham. Sir, saies shee, then let me request your company at my
                     house, at the Christopher, and, for old familiarity, spend your money there.
                     Not unlesse you goe backe, saies Tarlton. We will else goe to the Hound. But
                     she, loth to lose their custome, sent to London by her man, and goes back with
                     them ; who by the way had much mirth, for she was an exceeding merry honest
                     woman, yet would take anything : which Tarlton hearing, as wise as he was,
                     thinking her of his minde, he was deceived : yet he askt her if the biggest bed
                     in her house were able to hold two of their bignesse ; meaning himself and her.
                     Yes, saies she, and tumble up and downe at pleasure. Yea, one upon another,
                     saies Tarlton. And under, to, saies she. Well, to have their custome, she
                     agreed to everything, like a subtill oastesse : and it fell so out that
                     Tarlton, having her in a roome at her house, askt her which of those two beds
                     were big enough for them two. This, said she : therefore, goe to bed,
                     type="trait"&amp;gt;sweet-heart, Ile come to thee. Masse, saies Tarlton, were my
                     bootes off, I would, indeed. Ile help you, sir, saies she, if you please. Yea,
                     thought Tarlton, is the wind in that doore? Come on, then. And she very
                     diligently begins to pull, till one boot was half off. Now, saies she, this
                     being hard to doe, let me try my cunning on the other, and so get off both.
                     But, having both half off his legs, she left. him alone in the shoemakers
                     stocks, and got her to London, where Tarlton was three houres, and had no help.
                     But, being eas'd of his paine, he made this ryme for a theame, singing of it

                  <head>Tarlton's meeting with his countrey acquaintance at Ilford.</head>
                  <p>On a Sunday, Tarlton rode to llford, where his father kept; and, dining with
                     them at his sisters, there came in divers of the countrey to see him, amongst
                     whom was one plaine countrey plough-jogger, who said hee was of Tarlton's kin,
                     and so called him cousin. But Tarlton demanded of his father if it were so. But
                     he knew no such matter. Whereupon, saies Tarlton, whether he be of my kin or
                     no, I will be cousin to him ere we part, if all the drinke in Ilford will doe
                     it. So upon this they carouse freely, and the clowne was then in his cue, so
                     that, in briefe, they were both in soundly. Night came, and Tarlton would not
                     let his cousin goe, but they would lye together that night, meaning to drinke
                     at their departure next morning. Tarlton would by wit leave him in the lash,
                     since power would not. But see the jest. That night the plaine fellow so ....
                     Tarlton in his bed, thinking he had been against the church wall, that he was
                     faine to cry for a fresh shirt to shift. him. So, when al was well, they must
                     needs drinke at parting : where, indeed, to seale kindred soundly, the fellow
                     had his loade; for, hearing that his cousin Tarlton was gone to London, Zounds,
                     he would follow, that he would, none could hold him; and, meaning to goe
                     towards London, his aime was so good, that he went towards Rumford to sell his
                     hogs. </p>

                  <p>One asked Tarlton why Munday was called Sundaies fellow! Because he is a sausie
                     fellow, saies Tarlton, to compare with that holy day. But it may be Munday
                     thinkes himselfe Sundayes fellow, because it followes Sunday, and is next
                     after: but he comes a day after the faire for that. Nay, saies the fellow, but
                     if two Sundayes fall together, Munday then may be the first, and it would shew
                     well too. Yes, saies Tarlton, but if thy nose stood under thy mouth, it would
                     shew better, and be more for thy profit. How for my profit, said the fellow ?
                     Marry, said Tarlton, never to be cold in winter, being so neere every dogs
                     taile. The fellow seeing a foolish question had a foolish answere, laid his
                     legges on his neck, and got him gone. </p>

                  <p>Tarlton comming into a market towne bought oates for his horse, and desired
                     enough for money : the man said, You shall, sir, and gave him two halfe pecks
                     for one. Tarlton thought his horse should that night fare largely, and comes to
                     him with this rime:- </p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Jack Nag, be brag, and lustie brave it,</l>

                  <p>But when Jack Nag smelt to them they were so musty that he would none : God
                     thanke you, master : which Tarlton seeing, runnes into the Market, and would
                     slash and cut. But til the next market day the fellow was not to be found, and
                     before then Tarlton must be gone. </p>

                  <p>Tarlton in his travaile had a dogge of fine qualities ; amongst the rest, he
                     would carry sixpence in the end of his tongue, of which he would brag often,
                     and say, Never was the like. Yes, saies a lady, mine is more strange, for he
                     will beare a French crowne in his mouth. No, saies Tarlton, I thinke not. Lend
                     me a French crowne, saies the lady, and you shall see. Truly, madame, I have it
                     not, but if your dog will carry a crackt English crowne here it is. But the
                     lady perceived not the jest, but was desirous to see the dogs trick of
                     sixpence. Tarlton threw down a teaster, and said, Bring, sirra, and by fortune
                     the dog took up a counter, and let the money lie. A gentlewoman by, seeing
                     that, askt him how long he would hold it! An houre, saies Tarlton. That is
                     pretty, said the gentlewoman, let's see that. Meane time she tooke up the
                     sixe-pence, and willed him to let them see the money againe ; when he did see
                     it it was a counter, and he made this rime :- </p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Alas, alas, how came all this to passe !</l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>I, sayes the lady, and the dog hath made his master an asse. But Tarlton would

                     there was a goodly gentlewoman, that bravely mounted on a blacke horse, rode
                     exceeding well, to the wonder of all the beholders ; and neither hedge nor
                     ditch stood in her way, but Pegasus, her horse, for so may we tearme him for
                     swiftnesse, flew over all, and she sate him as well. When every one returned
                     home, some at supper commended hie hound, others his hawke and shee above all,
                     her horse. And, said she, I love no living creature so well, at this instant,
                     as my gallant horse. Yes, lady, a man better, saies Tarlton. Indeed no, said
                     shee, not now ; for since my last husband dyed I hate them most, unlesse you
                     can give me medicines to make me love them. Tarlton made this jest instantly :- </p>

                     <l>Why, a horse mingeth whay, madam, a man mingeth amber, A horse is for your
                        way, madam, but a man for your chamber.</l>

                  <p>But till then give me leave to love something. Then something will please you,
                     said Tarlton, I am glad of that, therefore I pray God send you a good thing or
                     none at all. </p>

                  <head>Tarlton's talke with a pretty woman.</head>
                  <p>Gentlewoman, said Tarlton, and the rest as you sit, I can tell you strange
                     things : now many gallants at supper noted one woman, who being little and
                     pretty, to unfit her prettinesse had a great wide mouth, which she seeming to
                     hide, would pinch in her speeches, and speake small, but .was desirous to heare
                     newes. Tarlton told at his comming from London to Norwich, a proclamation was
                     made that every man should have two wives. Now Jesus, qd. she, is it possible?
                     Ay gentlewoman, and otherwise able too, for contrarily women have a larger
                     preeminence, for every woman must have three husbands. Now Jawsus, said the
                     gentlewoman, and with wonder shewes the full widenesse of her mouth, which all
                     the table smil'd at ; which she perceiving, would answere no more. Now mistris,
                     said Tarlton, your mouth is lease than ever it was, for now it is able to say
                     nothing. Thou art a cogging knave, said she. Masse, and that is something, yet,
                     said Tarlton, your mouth shall be as wide as ever it was for that jest. </p>

                  <head>A jest of Tarlton to a great man.</head>
                  <p>There was a great huge man, three yards in the wast, at S. Edmondsbury, in
                     Suffolk, that died but of late daies, one M. Blague, by name, and a good kinde
                     justice, too, carefull for the poore : this justice met with Tarlton in Norwich
                     ; Tarlton, said he, give me thy hand. But you, sir, being richer , may give me
                     a greater gift, give me your body, and embracing him, could not halfe compasse
                     him. Being merry in talke, said the justice , Tarlton, tell me one thing, what
                     is the difference betwixt a flea and a louse? Marry, sir, said Tarlton, as much
                     and like difference as twixt you and me : I, like a flea, see else, can skip
                     nimbly, but you, like a fat louse, creepe slowly, and you can go no faster,
                     though butchers are over you, ready to knock you on the head. Thou art a knave,
                     quoth the justice. I, sir, I knew that, ere I came hither, else I had not been
                     here now, for ever one knave, making a stop, seekes out another. The justice,
                     understanding him, laughed heartily. </p>

                  <p>Tarlton going in the darke , groping out his way, heares the tread of some one
                     to meet him. Who goes there, saies he, a man or a monster! Said the maid, a
                     monster. Said Tarlton, a candle hoe ; and seeing who it was, Indeed, said he, a
                     monster, I'le be sworne, for thy teeth are longer than thy beard. 0, sir, said
                     the man, speake no more then you see, for women goe invisible now adayes. </p>

                  <p>Tarlton and his fellowes, being in the Bishop of Worcester's sellar, and being
                     largely laid to, Tarlton had his rouse, and going through the streets, a dogge,
                     in the middle of the street, asleep on a dunghill, seeing Tarlton reele on him,
                     on the sodaine barkt. How now, dog, saies Tarlton, are yon in your humours! and
                     many daies after it was a by-word to a man being drunke, that he was in his
                     humours. </p>
